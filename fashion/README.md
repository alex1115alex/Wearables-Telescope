# Wearables (Fashion)

This week I tooled around with adapting different 3D printable glasses frames from Thingiverse to the Telescope.

Fancy 1 (based on the Ray Ban Wayfarer):

## Documentation // how to reproduce

Nothing fancy, just print the .STL files at .12 layer height without supports (I manually added my own support column).
